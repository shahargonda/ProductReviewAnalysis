(laundry perfumes are the most toxic of all, it’s crazy how bad it is!) products with perfume, or, ‘parfume’ are listed as serious neurotoxins. meaning, touching and inhaling them will cause major harm to your brain / nervous system. why use them at all then? ...please just always use ‘free and clear’ or ‘hypoallergenic’ products. your skin absorbs at least 60% of what you put on it. imagine what babies go through with their sensitivity, and so many products for babies are riddled with dyes and perfumes. ...we figured that this jason body wash would be as good as their dye free / perfume free shampoo. but we tried this and it immediately overwhelmed us with harsh perfumes and other chemicals. also, it took days for the toxic perfume smells to finally rinse off of our skin. we suffered through respiratory and skin problems for days because of one use of this jason body wash product. we immediately switched back to our ‘everyone soap’ brand, which uses actual all-natural ingredients and essential oils, which have a gorgeous fragrant smell to them naturally, with no side effects! we were just hoping to try something new and thought we could trust good ol’ jason. . but that was a costly mistake. i don’t know why all people / companies don’t just use hypoallergenic skin and laundry products. hypoallergenic just means that it won’t poison you. so please keep your bodies and your families safer, and use products that are free from these truly toxic perfumes. essential oils are okay in most cases, just not perfume! if you see ‘perfume’ ‘parfum’ or ‘parfume’ anywhere in the ingredient list, don’t buy it, please! keep yourself, and your loved ones, as safe and happy as possible, in all ways! :-)good luck, friends! \n",
